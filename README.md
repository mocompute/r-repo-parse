# r-repo-parse

A parser of R package and repository metadata, namely the DESCRIPTION
and PACKAGES files which declare individual packages and their
dependencies.

## Status

Zig module: fully operational against CRAN repository.

C static library: proof of concept, but not operationally deployed.

# License

Currently licensed under GPL v3 or later primarily to prevent
its unrestricted commercial use. I am considering a more permissive
license.
